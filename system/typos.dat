TypoDesc      "You cannot hold any more wolves in your hunter's bag." Lol. This seems to 
imply that I'm stuffing the entire animal into my bag, which I'm not. I'm 
just saving the skin. Would you consider changing that line to: "You 
cannot hold any more (animal) hides/pelts/skins in your hunter's bag."
