Maybe it would be nice if you could mount player-dragons or player-centaurs. For example a dragonrider could attack enemys with shortbows or spells, or create magical shields for you and the dragon.

I like the idea of mounting player dragons, centaurs only if grouped.
This will lead to some nasty Role Play so not sure on what parameters if any should
be in place to discourage that.  Vladaar

You will receive some extra money and 1000000 exp for a tradeskill quest.

Also you could keep things under control by limiting the number of same ip chars that can attack in group. for example right now it's 1. you could limit it to 2 or 3 or whatever, that would keep it from getting too far out of control.

Also add a shoulder piece for tanners to compensate for the armor penalty addition so monk/bard/thief citizens aren't hampered.

I do agree jewelers could use something to spice them up.  But not sure on wing tips.  Why would they make something for a beast that doesn't benefit them?  Something jewel gemstone specific though would be nice.  Tanners having a shoulder piece might be a good idea.

[Sooc] 'right, but right now. i just went to the scholar and listened to everything he said and was still held there for about 20 seconds past him talking. it doesn't happen on every single section but amelia does it too, talk, give potions, tell you to run along ten seconds later you are allowed to leave, not before'
[Sooc] 'is there a way to make it so it will release you only after the last line of their text?'
[Sooc] 'instead of a straight timer?'
[Sooc] Vladaar 'maybe'
[Sooc] Vladaar 'I think we went with a timer because we wanted to let people choose speed of text for all progs in the game'

IdeaDesc      so I suggest we add hr/dr to some crafted eq.
Arms, legs, wrist, and ankles.
5hr/5dr each piece. This will only give crafted items a max of 30 not counting weapons. I believe this to be a reasonable compromise since if you go with crafted eq only you get amazing AC but crap for hr/dr and looted eq you can gain pretty damn good hr/dr but crap for AC and if you go half and half you don't really get above average on either.
&G
I think one or two gear types with hitroll damroll possibility would be good for crafted
gear.  Same token some of the gear you find in areas are quest items, and players have to
work really hard to get those hitroll damroll objects in the areas.  Plus crafted gear has
hitpoint bonuses, so you have higher hitpoints that non craftmen have to use their damroll
to reduce.

IdeaDesc      I've noticed that shamans don't really have much in the way of attack
or debuff. At least not below level 30. That's fine and all but if you're
wanting to add a bit of customization, perhaps you could add something shaman
related. Like hexing, or voodo, or some type of attack/debuff skill. Shamans
are renknowned for their connection to the "unformed lands" and spirit realms.
Perhaps something regarding aid from otherworldly spirits, or cosmic connection 
or some such. I think the idea of voodoo could be fun, or a hex you can place
on your opponent to lower stats, or impede movement. Or maybe even some kind of
insect swarm, or snake ally attack where you call forth a snake to strike your victim,

These could be for killing a certain amount of mobs, completing a certain amount of quests, finding secrets within areas, collecting a certain amount of gold, getting a given stat to a certain number, etc.
They would be in tiers, such as one for 100 gold, one for 1000, 1 for 1000000, etc.
Or for mobs, killed 100 mobs, killed 1000 mobs, etc.
Each achievement would give some kind of bonus, like money, experience or a bonus experience activation.

IdeaDesc      Given that Six Dragons only gives you a limited number of inventory slots, 
it'd be nice if there were a command that let you destroy items in your 
inventory. In a game with such a restrictive inventory, finding items 
which are nodrop/etc becomes a big pitfall unless you yourself have remove 
curse. Since it seems that mob healers don't cast remove curse unless the 
curse is on yourself, it shouldn't cost a death just to rid yourself of 
such items. Such a requirement seems to be counter intuitive towards the 
need to pick up items to examine them for their value in puzzles and 
equipment sets. Destroy would at least allow you to get rid of such items, 
without the benefits granted by remove curse (being able to freely use 
said item). 
&G

yah not a destroy command, but maybe more methods of getting cursed items off.

If not, I think it is good if I can know the distance of a landmark beore deciding to travel there. It will certainly help a lot.
As for now, I only know when a certain landmark is too far away to see.

IdeaDesc      Once we have a crafting template in our inventory (ergo, once we've began 
the initial crafting command such as tan x into y z), can we please be 
able to just type the base command to continue the process? Having to type 
tan x into y z or forge x into y z repeatedly is awkward at best. 
Furthermore, if I use exclamation point to repeat the command and 
something happens, I am then forced to retype the command. This is simple 
enough for me on MUSHClient, as I have command history, but others may not 
have the same luxury. Furthermore, if I chat, and then use the exclamation 
point out of reflex, I end up sending the communication twice. I know I 
could script an alias to do this for me, but I think other crafters would 
benefit from having the interface simplified so that, once they create 
their craft template, they can just type tan, forge, etc to continue.

IdeaDesc      Hi,
I have a few ideas for even more sounds for the sound pack. It would be great to have a sound for continuing a quest, for completing a quest, for discovering a new area. These would also help with accessibility, since these messages can easily get lost in scroll. Also, sounds for others saying something or making an emote would be great as well, for the same reasons.
Just a few thoughts, maybe you can add them.

IdeaDesc      I really feel, aftr playing several psionics and looking at them very closely,
that their defensive capabilities are extremely lacking. Yes they have the OP
skill "disable" at 92 to stop aggro mobs in an entire area from attacking, yeah.
BUt as far as physical defense goes, they get really nothing besides a barrier, some
thicken
chameleon
added armor class from thicken skin, and density. Just thought you might want to looka t it

IdeaDesc      Druids form would benefit well from increase HR/DR in the different forms
Example could be, Wolfs would get Higher HR over Damage because their tactile an fast,
Where as bears are Sheer force of power an dont rely on speed, Also i think a deal kind've like
dragons have a Size bonus that with Druids their HR/DR Overall Increases with LEVEL on a scale
From the first level you get Animal Form, Like Level X= 1/1 Then next level would add 1/1 Again, So forth
this is to compensate for the fact you cant wear as much Gear, An also right now All the forms are WEAKER then
a Regular druid.
Also i believe the Owl form would make a Superb Caster form with its increase mana an Mana regen if they could cast all spells
while in that form.

a minor heal. Something like psionics healing thoughts. After all, even vampires have
supernatural healing through cannablize, I was thinking something similar.
But cannabalize takes too much blood for such a low heal.

IdeaDesc      I am using a book as a reference in regard to bard abilities.
In spellsinger, the main character uses a lute, and voice
to conjure magic. One of his abilities is transportation.
He imagines the place, then sings a few lines about it,
and boom. Instant transportation to location.
I was thinking around level 45ish, druids could get
an ability like this. Make it a carbon copy
of psionics astral travel, or mages astral walk
you can call it "Song of Destination, or Traveling Tune"

Utilizing ancient rituals, the shaman can either undergo a vision quest themself,
or help an ally undertake a vision quest. After experiencing such a liberating
connection to the unformed lands, the recipient of the vision expresses a more
profound understanding of the world, which manifests itself in ways such as
increased wisdom, constitution, and a temporary boost to mana.
