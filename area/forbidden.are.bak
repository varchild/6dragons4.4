An adult silver dragon is training young dragons here.

through her left eye. Her silver scales are scratched but no duller than 
those of her students. Formidable claws and a spike-tipped tail in

teaching has not slowed the silver dragon down in the slightest.

This gruesome creature resembles its common rat cousin, but is mutilated 
almost beyond recognition. Its matted fur shows tears and hints of caked 
blood. Crimson eyes are unfocused, its maw dripping blood and saliva 
constantly due to its infection, which causes the wererat to stagger about 
and twitch constantly.

Gsaar~
An adult blue dragon gate guard is on duty here.
~
This silver haired dragonlord stands at around six foot tall, but his 
shadow is strangely long and appears to form the shape of a great dragon. 
Though he looks to be an adult in his prime, his red eyes show the 
weariness of ancients. The brass keyring on his belt stands out against 
his black guard outfit.
