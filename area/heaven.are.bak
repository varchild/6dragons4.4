cain shadowy creature~
Cain~
A hideous, shadowy creature creeps here.
~
From within the shadows of this secret, dank and dark chamber, this twisted
creature floats forth.  Both shadowy and powerful-looking, Cain is the sad
product of a fallen aasimar, the effects of evil and self-torture.  However,
a glint in his black and sunken eyes seems to reveal that both blood and 
unfound treasures keep his interest.

body is built like a tank, muscles rippling and built upon others like a
mountain. His eyes flash with extreme and divine power, but the moment he
smiles you feel much safer and much more at ease.

Gavin~
Gavin, the bartender of the "Winged Palatte", serves here.
~
This is Gavin, equally famous as the Owner and Bartender of the reknowned
Tavern, the "Winged Palatte". Tales are sung across the land of Gavin's
masterful skill of cookery, his art of gourmet, and of his excellently
(and equally) potent drinks. To stand up to such legends, it takes quite a
person, and indeed stands before you one, as he has witnessed the Dawn of
Time, he has served during the Mage Wars, and he will serve until his
silver hair falls limp to the ground upon the Day of Ragnarok.

tankard nectar~
This is a large tankard, with a smooth curled lip and a big handle, both
made in the same style, straight and smooth metal.  There is an old
enameled design around the Tankard, one of them being the winged tongue
icon, others being little sketches and paintings depicting archangel
battles with demons.  The legendary godly nectar, only found in Heaven,
bubbles away in this cup, just asking to be drunk.  Even now, just the
smell of it tantalizes the senses and tickles your fancy!

of different celestials of all types, a soft and soothing seraphim choir
can be heard with such heavenly music that even the cloud tufts smile.

"CLOUD STREET" hangs from between two lantern archons high in the air 
above the bustling shopping community and between the rows of shops that 
line the Street. It seems this shopping district was so named for the soft
and puffy ground, and the small cloud tufts which float up and down the 
street nonchalantly. To the north is an old building spiked with a faded
sign, while a splendidly magnificent store filled with toys is to the south.

full of prayers and chants as the grand Church lays far to the east.  Many
cherubim fly up and down the road occasionally, humming mantras and looking
particularly stern and devout, hovering closely above the groves of colorful
flora that line the Road.  To the south stands a lone structure, domed in a
golden-colored glass high in the upper clouds.

tip, with magical etchings in the celestial tongue, holding divine power,
all over the weapon.  What a work of art!

&WNow finding the end of the Everbright Way, the cumulus tufts give way to
firmer and harder blocks of solid grey stone, all of which lead up to a
great Temple crafted of the same stone, fortified in the virtue and power,
consecrated in glory and faith, and hallowed in the Light of good - this 
must be the divine Temple of Solomon.  It seems to wonder, however, how one
would enter, as nothing but arcane runes mark the ubiquitous Temple stones.

arcane runes~
&WAs you peruse ancient runes of a long forgotten tongue, they glow with a
blue light momentarily as their forms shift and rearrange themselves to
create a great, circular rune with what resembles a crucifix glowing in
the center, surrounded by a glowing circle of blue that closely resembles
the outline for an entrance.

&WAs one travels down the Light Turn, one cannot help but smell many many
different and aromatic scents, that of celestial folk, of Gavin's ambrosia,
of travelling spirits, of iced creams and dandied sweets from up the Light
Turn... the hustling crowd that moves in both directions seems busy enough
besides, as Cloud Street and the Turn both have many delectable places full
of business and merriment.&D

~
&WThe Corner of Light Turn here is filled with performers, a small stage,
some open shops to the west and northwest and lots of music and merriment!
Some smooth male tones echo from the barbershop to the west, and something
really sweet issues a wafting mist from the northwest as laughter and gaity
take control of the Light Turn Corner!  One should watch out, or they might
be trampled on by a cheery mob or run into a happy crowd heading down to the
"Winged Palatte", which is only south and down Cloud Street from here.&D
&WAlso, the famous Sweet Shop of Heaven, Suword's Dandy Candy, beams to the
north here, many children and miniature cherubim scrambling inside.

A great pipe organ booms to the east, notes pouring out sonorously like

cloudskin, brass and wood hang from the edges of the white tarp above.
Tables displaying beautifully crafted harps and horns are surrounded by a
merry mob of folk as music roams across the clouds.&D

&CInside The Temple Of Solomon&D~
~
This is a grand Temple, evidently built more for strength and awe than a
grandly displayed show of wealth or perpetual use.  It must be that not many
have ever found the way inside, as there are no footstep marks in the dust
that collects all over the floor and walls.  Mounted torches burn along the
walls, providing a dim light and the smell of camphor and ash.  The large
stone chamber has a single hallway whose light cannot be fathomed because of
the twisting path, and a partially hidden entrance is to the north.

It seems that this dark chamber is laid with a thick fog, pouring from a hole
in the floor, but whether that fog is of fear, evil or a water spout and
low air pressure cannot be determined.  What is for certain, however, is
that this unlit chamber somehow has an innate looming darkness about it,
and it would not do well to stay for very long!

&CThe Labyrinth of Atonement&D~
~
A thick fog lays upon the ground and hangs in the air here, clouding vision
and thought.  This appears to be a dank labyrinth, for the purpose of holding
creatures for them to atone, yet it seems that much evil still thrives here
in each monster and shadow that lurks in the dark.

see, smelling of mold and cold ash.  Several cobwebs line the corners and

see, smelling of mold and cold ash.  Several cobwebs line the corners and
edges, perhaps covering forsaken treasures or miniscule cobs and hobs.  A
muggy, humid atmosphere encompasses the entire hallway, and the walls almost
seem to move towards each other as one progresses upon the stone floor.

~
&WA white parlour with a black countertop, cabinets, and a black-and-white
checkered floor seem fit for a Candy Shop, and very clean also.  Cleaned
white booths line the southern wall across from the sales floor, and many
cupids and small children scramble across the booths and the checkered tile
floor, just inching to see some yummy candy.

A polished black counter of marble arches in an arc gracefully about the

numerous candies, prominently showing a golden-wrapped chocolate bar that
reads "SUWORD BAR" upon the wrapping, a chewy-looking caramel rod, a nice
and traditional dandy sweet, and a cane of sugar and colored icing. MmMmMmm!

lie some barrels against the eastern wall, most likely more backstock and

gold and silver star fragments and toy ornaments, and sparkling wrapped
packages with brightly colored bows!  And my, what decorations that stream
from wall to wall, and nice paper boxes in the far corner!  A mood of pure
innocence and happiness fills the large parlor, and smiles are everywhere.

This is a large, very regal Hall high inside the Temple of Solomon, although
these expansive chambers have much more comfort and more life than the halls
of stone that wind and twist ubiquitously below.  A large and heavily engraved
silver crucifix rests against the middle of the southern wall, where the red
carpeted floor slopes downwards into a shadowed chamber.  Many tapestries and
paintings cover the walls as bits of stardust litter the air before the
ceiling yet high off the carpeted floor which leads further north.

way back into this particular fold of the heavens above.
