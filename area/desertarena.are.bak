Shifting Sands~
~
Flat terrain as far as an eye can see. A small well is half hidden here by 
the shifting sands. The clouds flit by, occasionally blocking the sun 
momentarily. The heat rolls off the sand in waves, the sun beating down 
ceaselessly.

Sand, nothing but sand. The sun beating down, the heat from the sand 
searing and oppressive. There looks to be no end in sight to this gods 
forsaken sand.

barren, hot ground. There seems to be a shimmer in the distance, is it the 
heat or could it be an oasis.

haven nearby. The sun baking relentlessly down upon the sands, cooking 
anything it comes in contact with for more than a minute.
