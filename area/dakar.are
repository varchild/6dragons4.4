dark elf drow city manager Taerva~
City Manager Taerva~
A devious looking dark elf city manager stands here.
~
&wTall for one of his kind, this drow stands as high as the average man. 
White hair flows from his scalp down to his shoulders, untied but well 
kept. His clothing is all black, from vest to boots, and his muscular 
frame is clearly visible. A spear is kept within easy reach, should the 
need arise, but he looks as though he is more than capable of solving most 
problems without it.&d

Dravea~
A tall orc stands guard at the city gate.
~
&OThis orc is about what you would expect for one of its kind. Two tusks 
protrude from his upper lip, one missing the point. His eyes are red and 
unfocused, as he lazily surveys the area before him. He stands well above 
where a tall human would, and his frame is almost completely composed of 
muscle.&d
