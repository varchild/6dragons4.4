say the Fenris Wolf, it could not be slain; more's the pity for
say Loki's evil children cause us no end of trouble. So Odin 
say cast it into the sea, where it grew to such an immense size
say that it now encircles Midgaard, and there it will remain until...

the Fenris Wolf~
A wolf of mammoth proportions towers over you.
~
This "wolf" is actually the demonic offspring of Loki. Standing at over
fifty feet high, it is a wonder that even the Aesir managed to capture it.
They are not allowed to slay the offspring of a god, so they had to bind it
here instead. Odin would not be displeased, however, were he to find out it
was dead.

The blizzard is less fierce at this point, and as you peer through the
blinding snow you think you can make out a glittering bridge in the
distance. But no matter how much you try to reach it, it always seems
to be too far away. At a loss, you wander aimlessly, not knowing what
to do.

Before Bifrost~
~
You arrive suddenly, at the eastern end of Bifrost, the mighty rainbow
bridge that allows entrance into Asgard, realm of the Aesir. Standing
upon this bridge is Heimdall, sworn guardian of the Rainbow Bridge,
protecting Asgard from the giants of Jotunheim or other foes who might
seek to cross it and enter the home of the gods.

Bifrost~
~
The rainbow bridge shimmers beneath your feet, sending shivers through
your frame, and you pause more than once to stare in awe out over the
starry expanse it spans. To the west lies a small collection of lodges,
homes of the Aesir, gods of Midgaard. In the center of these houses arises
a mighty tree- Yggdrasil, the tree of life, the one tree, the tree that
joins all.

Asgard~
~
The bridge ends at a cobbled road that runs west towards a series of
wooden lodges, arranged about the boughs of Yggdrasil. A narrow path
runs up from here to the edge of a cliff; you think you can smell the
sea. The streets of the realm of the Aesir are quiet; few footprints
mark the light coating of snow that covers most of the region.

The Shores of the Sea~
~
You are standing at the edge of a wind driven sea; choppy waves break
over the rocky shoreline near your feet. A chill wind numbs your bones
and you shiver as you try to peer across the foggy depths. An occasional
roar, as of some behemoth uttering its own particular profanity, echoes
across the sea, and you imagine you can see something- something large,
very large- shifting about under the waters.

Yggdrasil~
~
You are standing at the middle branches of Yggdrasil, holy tree upon
which all the planes converge. By ascending or descending the mighty
boughs of this magnificent tree, you may reach various other sections of
Asgard, including Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Hel and Gladsheim.
A cobbled path continues west into the main streets of the homes of the
Aesir.

Vanaheim~
~
You find it remarkably easy to scale the mighty boughs of Yggrdrasil,
achieving a considerable rate of ascent as you clamber ever upward into
the top levels of the Tree of Life. At various points, branches run away
from the tree, heading into various parts of the Realm of the Gods; one
such branch extends into a leafy forest to the south.

Entering Alfheim~
~
Towering trees, their branches heavy with snow, loom to either side of
a narrow dirt track that bears the imprints of many pairs of booted 
feet and animal hooves. The air here is sharp, and fresh, and you inhale
great gusts with pleasure. Small songbirds chirp loudly as they flutter
about the massive oaks, pines and aspens of Alfheim, realm of the elves
and their ruler, Frey.

Alfheim~

The path continues into the depths of this famous glade, widening
considerably as it passes more stretches of forest, the trees extending
as far as you can see. Laughter and song is carried in on the wind from
the east, and you feel several pairs of eyes watching you from the safety
of the trees at all times.

Alfheim~

At this point a clear bubbling stream cuts across the path, which
diverts to the south accordingly to avoid the plesant obstruction.
A variety of small fish swim in its clear flowing waters, oblivious
to your presence. Occasionally a bird will flutter down to investigate
the wake caused by a fish passing close to the surface, then return,
disinterested, to the haven of its nest.

The path bends again here, heading east once more, the stream having
emptied into a large depression in the soft ground between some large
trees to the north. This curious sinkhole descends to other parts of
Valhalla, places not meant to be seen by mortal eyes. Nor is Alfheim
really, actually.

You cannot remember having ever been in a more peaceful forest than
this one; strolling casually beneath the protective overhanging boughs
of the mighty trees of Vanaheim you feel totally at ease. You know that
no harm will come to you in this place, unless of course you provoke 
such an action from the realm's inhabitants, who will react with
understandable zeal to protect their haven.

The Heart of Alfheim~
~
The path ends in a small clearing, from which several lodges lead,
each housing a lord of Alfheim or one of their many allies and minions,
though Frey and Freya would be loathe to label their friends as the 
latter. Music fills the air, the clear tenor of a superb skald raised
in harmonious praise of this wondrous realm. Small animals such as
squirrels, badgers and dogs rush about, scampering and frolicking in
abandon, confident in the protection of their elven lord. Frey is indeed
fortunate in his residence; what god could want for a more peaceful
domicile?

Approaching the Wooden Lodges~

The ground becomes harder here, and the path much wider, as it approaches
a small collection of wooden lodges to the north, undoubtedly the
residences of the lords of this realm. Few mortals indeed have traversed
this far into the home of Frey and Freya, and it is with not a small
degree of trepidation that you advance upon those known to most as gods.

Stables of Blodug-Hofi~
~
Although these magnificent stables that you have entered appear to be
capable of housing three score of mighty warhorses, there is evidence
of but one steed being quartered here; the steed of Frey and thus considered
worthy of such accommodations. Stout oak rafters support a thatched roof,
while the whitewashed walls are filled with hooks that bear various tack
and saddle care items, as well as several mammoth sacks of oats.

Equally magnificent as the counterpart to the west, these stables
contain a single chariot, large enough to easily carry a dozen men,
and a large pile of fresh straw, upon which Gullin-Bursti, boar of
Frey, rests when weary, which is seldom indeed for the sturdy porcine
pet. He draws Frey's chariot when the mood takes Frey to travel about
in it, and is never far from his master's side.

The interior of this long wooden lodge is filled with all manner of
trappings, from pelts taken from wild animals slain in the hunt to
a range of trophies sequestered away from their giant and orcish owners,
whom where all slain or driven away by Frey and his pets. A series of
crossed spears topped by boarhide shields line a narrow ledge set three
feet below the ceiling signifies this as the home of a norse god, who
despite his peaceful demeanour and surrounds is quite capable of performing
admirably alongside his peers when battling enemies of Asgard.

and the end of their reign. Such fatalism seems ignorant to you, but you

The stairs end before a solid wooden door, which speaks in volumes
by its closed and locked state of those within's desire not to be
disturbed. Especially by upstarts from Midgaard! Warmth radiates through
the wooden portal, presumably from a blazing fire within. Shaking your
head, you wonder if it might not be worth risking the wrath of the Aesir
to share a little of that warmth.

to gain entrance can expect a rough reception if they are caught in the
midst of their transgression. A few small chairs have been arranged here,
for those Aesir who desire a bit of peace and quiet.

including events such as the coming of the Aesir, the defeat of the giants
of Jotunheim, and the eventual coming of Ragnarak, which is the inevitable
fate of the fate-obsessed Aesir.

giant skulls, most of them bearing evidence of the sledgehammer blows that
felled them. Large bearskin rugs cover the walls and floor, which is of

There is little here of real value; they do not seek to acquire loads
of booty or treasure. Instead, the majority of the items take the form
of trinkets and personal mementos, as well as gifts from their friends
amongst the Aesir and Vanir, and the Modsogner and Durin dwarves.

~
The gates of Valaskialf are of wood bound with mithril, and glow 
oddly, the result of an enchantment that prevents them being forced
open by strength, thus deterring any giants who feel brave enough to
challenge the ruler of the Aesir. Runes carved into the rough hewn
surface label the place as Valaskialf, and as the Home of Odin. They
give off a brilliant glow, almost blinding in its intensity, and almost
unbearable for your mortal eyes to behold. There is no sign of a lock
or bar, yet the doors remain firm and refuse to yield when you push against
them.

grave import, seated about the oak table that rests before the hearth.
Papers and maps are scattered all over the table along with the occasional
sword or hammer scar, where an angry Aesir has vented his wrath more than
once on the hapless furniture. Statues rest in each corner of the room
depicting each of the four elements. Large bearskins have been nailed to
the walls, and a white dragon hide dominates the high wooden ceiling.

white dragon hide~
The hide was taken from the body of a large white dragon, slain by
Thor and his sons, and was brought here as a gift to Odin and the other
Aesir. Large patches of the skin are heavily abraded, evidence of the
mighty blows struck it by Mjolnir.

Before Hlidskialf~
~
Few people indeed outside the Aesir have been inside Valaskialf, and
Odin likes it that way. This is his private residence; he prefers to
conduct official business in his council chambers, or, more rarely, at
appointed places in Midgaard. The interior of the main hall is similar
to most Aesir lodges, save that the main chamber bears a massive throne,
placed before a roaring fireplace.

The Durin Forge~
~
This chamber is bathed in a reddish glow, its source the roaring blaze
that provides the great heat necessary to forge the many weapons these
ancient and proud dwarves produce. It was in these fires that Mjolnir
itself was forged, for Thor, and other wondrous relics of the Aesir and
Vanir alike. The heat is oppressive and unbearable for long periods of
time.

The Chambers of Fjalar~
~
This large stony hall houses Flajar, the greatest of the Durin and a
fearsome warrior and giantslayer. Feared and respected by friend and
foe alike, his power in combat is not to be scoffed at, despite his
diminutive stature. His abode is simple, and spartan, as you'd expect
of this sworn soldier of the Durin. Relics from previous victories are
his only vanities- several giant skulls, and weapons, plus the hide of
a polar bear and a white dragon.

The End of the Tunnel~
~
The long tunnel ends here, at a junction, where two large chambers lie
to the west and southeast. The gothic architecture of this place never
ceases to amaze you; intricate stonework inlaid over the centuries 
with complex patterns and sculptings. Ancient banners hang from dark
metal rods, while suits of armor and crossed axes line a ledge at head
height (to a dwarf). Despite the fact that the inhabitants are rarely
over five feet in height, the ceiling is a good twenty feet above you.

A Junction~
~
Several tunnels meet here, branching off into the gloom of the Durin
cave complex. Inhabitants are few; war and time have ravaged their
numbers, and they know that one day their race will die out, as all
things eventually do. These halls are a testament, however, to this 
race's long and glorious history, of war and of excellence in the art
of smithing and stonemasonry.

A Bend in the Tunnel~
~
The tunnel bends here, heading east towards a junction. Smoldering
brands thrust into iron cressets mounted on the finished walls cast
a little light through the pervasive subterranean gloom, while a dim
glow, from light reflecting off uncut gemstones piled near the walls,
is also visible. The dwarves live where they work, here in the mines
of their ancestors.

The Tunnels of the Durin~
~
The Durin live in vast subterranean complexes, like their sworn enemy
the giants, though it is there that the similarity ends. For while
giant lairs are dark, grim places with little to recommend them, the
tunnels of the Durin are of finished stone, inlaid with intricately
carved murals that are indicative of the superb skill of the artisans.
Statues of their ancestors line the walls, seeming to support the roof
of the tunnels that serve as their income and their residences.

Descending into the Darkness~
~
The tunnel descends steeply, the walls showing signs of working with
tools, though only in parts, where a vein of minerals has been found
by these expert miners and stonemasons. Few dwarves can be found in
here; their numbers are small, and dwindling by the decade. One day
these halls will be the sole reminder that this proud and ancient 
race ever existed.

A Guard Cave~
~
A small cave, of unworked stone, contains but a single visible exit-
a tunnel that descends sharply into the darkness below and whatever
it contains. There is a small campfire here, doubtless used by the
alert sentry posted here by the doughty Durin, to stand guard here.
Raids by the giants are undoubtedly frequent, and thus the need for
tight security.

The Mines~
~
Rich veins of copper, silver and mithril are visible even to the novice
miner's eye in the rough walls of this section of tunnel. The Durin are
in the process of mining this section, thus the rough surfaces, and are
hoping to extract the wealth from here before the giants drive them out
yet again, forcing them to seek another new lair. It is hoped that the
wealth accumulated here will enable them to fund their seemingly futile
effort to defeat all giantkind.

This rough hewn tunnel is dimly lit, and thus you stumble more than
once on a pick or pile of ore, or bang into a mine cart as you make

what they may from the natural reserves of precious metals before it
is too late.

This point marks the limit of Durin excavation; the wall to the south
shows signs of having been dug at, though not extensively as there is
sufficient to keep the miners occupied in the veins already unearthed.
Piles of metal awaiting refinement lie next to several carts, ready to
be taken to the smith.

The Hall of Forseti~

You stride into the protective shelter of a hall that appears to be
composed entirely of gold and other precious metals; the effect is quite
dazzling and you blink in disbelief. All this gold! So little time to
try and steal it... Shaking yourself free of such delusions, you peer about
and note the many representations of Law and Order, and realize that the
owner of this mighty hall is undoubtedly of honorable mein and equally
undoubtedly quite capable of preventing vandalism or theft of his wealth.

The hall that serves as home to Balder's son certainly lives up to its
name. Every surface gleams in your light, and you cannot help but be
impressed by the casual display of such an abundance of precious metals.
No wonder that mortals speak in awestruck tones of Forseti's golden,
glittering hall. The god himself sits in a simple wooden chair, from
which he dispenses justice or advice as requested by his companions and
family.

Gazing eastward, your eyes widen as you see a broad plain littered

realize that you are gazing upon the fields of Valhalla, where the fabled
Einheriar do battle daily, in preparation for Ragnarok. Long wooden lodges
encircle the plain, where the Einheriar rest between their neverending 
series of battles.

cries of men in the midst of bloodlust rages, intent on slaughtering each
other, preparing for Ragnarok, when they will be led in final battle against
the giants. Every day, at dawn, their spirits arise from the halls of
Valhalla, where they are brought by the Valkyries, and they do battle with
each other till the sun sets, when they rest and engage in revelry.

The Marine Court~
~
A stone courtyard, encrusted with barnacles that tear at your clothing as
you pass, stretches before you, teeming with all manner of marine life. A
sense of peace, after escaping the storm, is soon supplanted by a growing
unease as you regard some of the dark horrors of the depths, never meant
to be seen by surface dwellers. The master of this domain appears to be
well guarded.

The Storm-Tossed Sea~

Adrift on the churning, frigid waters, you cannot see land anywhere
you look. The icy spray freezes on your face, and your hands turn
blue as you grip onto whatever is keeping you afloat. Only a fool
would attempt to negotiate these waters; and it is a fool you must
be, to be out here. Long, dark shapes move silently beneath the
salty brine, barely visible through the foam.

Plunging into the Depths~
~
You sink like a stone as you hit the water, quickly swept under by the
raging sea, which quickly becomes apparent is a blessing; if you can 
survive here, it is much more pleasant than the surface. Schools of 
fish swim past while larger predators dart here and there, snapping at
them as they flee into the deep blue waters. The water is cold, but is
kept from freezing you by a warm current that rises from far below the
surface. This haven from the tempest atop is welcome indeed!

You reach the bottom of the sea, sooner than you expected, and look around.
A stone courtyard, encrusted with barnacles that tear at your clothing as
you pass, stretches before you, teeming with all manner of marine life. A
sense of peace, after escaping the storm, is soon supplanted by a growing
unease as you regard some of the dark horrors of the depths, never meant
to be seen by surface dwellers. The master of this domain appears to be
well guarded.

The Throne of the Sea God~
~
A rather ominous cave is revealed by shoving the pillar away, and it
is suddenly difficult to move forwards; a strong current, its source
magical, pushes at you, and warming you; evidently this is the source
of the warmth you felt earlier. The cave boasts little of interest, 
save for a large throne of barnacles, that have covered the original
stone one. To sit on it would invite agony, though its owner appears
to be able to do so without discomfort.

You pass into a huge cavern, from which numerous passages branch off,
into the subterranean lairs of the many races that battle over the
bloody fields of Jotunheim. An uncharacteristically warm breeze wafts
in from the passages on this level, while the upper and lower exits
lead to icy dark passages. Skulls and broken weapons litter the floor
here, the site of many battles between giant and dwarf.

A larger section of the tunnels widens into a cavern, lit by torches
set in iron cressets, while braziers stacked with coals warm the whole
room to an uncomfortable temperature. Long, giantish weapons hang on
the walls, ready to be taken up against the many enemies of the giants
in times of strife, most commonly when Thor arrives for his regular
sortie against his mortal enemies.

Downwards the tunnels twist, further into the depths of the mountain,
heading towards its molten core, which is paradise to the cold hating
fire giants. Footsteps echo all around you, as giants make their way
through their subterranean lair, on business of their own. There are
little decorations in this abode; the giants possess less skill than
the dwarves in stonemasonry, and less interest.

The tunnel ends in a dead end here, in a cavern used to store various
supplies taken by the giants when they emerge from their lair to make
war on Asgard or the Durin. Occasionally a giant force will travel as
far as Midgaard, to aid their cousins there, though if truth be known 
the giants of your realm are more advanced than these barbaric tribes
men.

The tunnel slopes down sharply again; the walls here are smooth and
featureless, as if they had been worn smooth by water... or lava. It
would make sense for the fire giants to lair in or near the greatest
source of heat they could find, and what better source than a rocky
cave system atop (or within) a volcano? Giants of your own realm are
similarly inclined.

The lava tube continues downwards, before at last levelling out to
head northeast towards a large cavern, which is so brightly lit as
to be visible from here, the reddish glow bathing this whole tunnel
in light. Giants mill about, semi-alert for intruders, but mostly
impatiently awaiting the next raid.

As the tunnel approaches the bright cave it widens, to a point where
six giants could walk abreast. It is frightening to consider the sheer
volume of lava it would take to fashion this tunnel, as it melted its
way through the softer rock, before erupting onto the surface, there
to add a new layer to the mountain. The master of this realm cannot be
far from here now.

The Infernal Throne of Surtur~
~
Here lies the throne of Surtur, lord of the fire giants. It is a towering
chair of iron, ablaze with magical flame of brilliant hues of red and blue,
which cast a blinding light throughout the cavernous halls. Large stone statues
of fire giants wielding massive swords flank the throne, and line the hall,
which is a deep red, and is shot through with rivulets of molten lava, the heat
from which is almost unbearable. The ceiling is of dark stone, and appears to
have once been the mouth of an active volcano or cinder cone.

You stagger out of the blizzard into a large cave, set in the side

Bones are scattered across the floor, some of them twice the size of you.
A dreadful, keening wail echoes about the cave, from some unknown source.
Presumably you have stumbled inadvertently upon the realm of the giants;
Jotunheim. But how to proceed...?

Ascending the Mountain~
~
This tunnel rises sharply, heading away from the hot interior back up
to the chilly upper tunnels of the mountain you are within. You must
be approaching the lair of the frost giants, who prefer the cold and
ice more than any native of Asgard and its neighboring realms. It is
with some reluctance you continue; frost giants of Jotunheim are far
more powerful than those of Midgaard.

The Icy Caverns~
~
The tunnel evens out on an icy ledge, which is not dissimilar to those
of the legendary realm of the frost giants of Midgaard, known as the
Glacial Rift. Here, the ice is all that is beneath your feet; it has
been carved from the frozen water that filled the open spaces in the
mountain to create tunnels to allow the inhabitants to move through.

The Icy Caverns~
~
The ice tunnel continues, winding through the top of the mountain,
heading presumably towards the master of this icy realm, the mighty
frost giant known as Thrym, sworn enemy of Aesir and Vanir, and he
also who it is predicted will with his armies one day slay Thor in
battle at Ragnarok. Actually, this is Thrym's skewed version of the
prophecy; the Aesir believe Thor will fall at the hands of the world
serpent, Jormungand.

The Center of the Blizzard~
~
You clamber up the sink hole, and emerge back into the icy wastes,
though at this point there is a curious lull in the continual storms.
A massive icy clearing is here, atop a mountain, bearing a massive iron
spike driven deep into the mountain, to which something of immense size
is presumably meant to be tethered.

The Icy Caverns~

At this point an icy chute ascends sharply, heading up to a ledge on
top of this massive peak. Snow drifts are piled here, where snow has
entered the lair from above. Footprints of giants and wolves mark it,
though few head upwards into the shaft itself, which is accessible
via a series of hand- and footholds.

The Icy Chute~
~
Onwards and upwards the chute ascends; progress is hampered by frostbite
in your aching hands, and a constant chill breeze that assaults you,
blowing ice and snow into your reddened face. When you emerge, snowblind
and dazed, you hope you can muster enough energy to do battle with what
awaits.

The Icy Throne of Thrym~
~
The chambers of the Frost Giant King, Thrym, lie before you, where the giant
rests in between battles against the Aesir and the Vanir, with or without his
sometime ally Surtur. Thrym is a strong giant, nowhere near as strong as
Surtur, but what he lacks in comparison to the fire giant he more than makes
up for with his cunning and guile. While Surtur is quite happy to mindlessly
assault Asgardians in direct combat, Thrym tries to plan and make much more
intelligent tactical decisions. However, he is still but a giant, and often
fails in his efforts to outsmart the Aesir, though Loki has been known to aid
him from time to time.

Niflheim~
~
The second you step down onto this blackened branch you instinctively
know you have reached the underworld, where Hel and her minions receive
the souls of the dishonorable dead, to torment them for eternity. Flame
has scorched the surrounding foliage here, creating a canopy of ash and
cinder, which frames a gaping cave entrance to the east, within which you
will encounter the most malevolent residents of the Tree.

The Gates of Niflheim~
~
Blackened, mangled metal gates rise here, out of a dark field of 
enveloping gloom. A chill runs up and down your spine, despite the
heat that emanates from blazing fires that fill braziers to either side
of the gate. Thick smoke chokes your lungs and clouds your vision, and
the stench of brimstone is strong. Were that you were anywhere but here
in this fell domain! You can see no way of opening the gate, which is too
hot to touch and bears no handle or lock besides. Perhaps it is better
that you do not continue, for to do so could well mean your end.

Blasted, twisted trees sprout haphazardly from broken, uneven ground
littered with decaying corpses and burnt skulls. Impaled humans howl
and scream in pain as they dangle from the horrid implements thrust
through their bellies. Blood drips from the blackened walls, flowing
into large pools at your feet. The smell is as diabolical as one would
expect in such a dire place.

Fell shapes and shadows hurl themselves at you out of the bloody gloom,
eager to feast on your body and soul. No mortal would sanely venture
here unless they were one of the fallen who were deemed unworthy of
Valhalla. But undaunted you press on, mostly because the edit that you
passed through to enter this infernal realm has disappeared...

Your every sense is assaulted and offended by this realm of the dead;
it is more than that even, it is a realm of the damned, those totally
devoid of any hope of redemption. No one would willingly reside in
such a place, except as its dark master, which Hel is. She is aware
of all who pass through her realm, and most likely lies in wait not
far away, eager to teach you a well-deserved lesson.

Onwards the corpse-strewn path of bone contines, past blasted trees
which support the weight of mutilated souls in their branches, who
cry out for an end to this torment as you pass, an end that no one
save Hel herself can grant, and there is little hope of her doing so.
The flayed, limbless trunks of the damned flail about at your feet,
driven insane by the pain inflicted on their crippled forms.

A Fiery Death~
~
You stumble and topple forwards into the fiery pit, screaming as the
flesh is blasted from your bones by an immense wave of heat, reducing
your idiotic mortal form to ash in milliseconds. And while the death
may have been mercifully quick, the repurcussions of the destruction 
of your mortal form will haunt you for some time...

The path ends abruptly here, before the bottomless pit, from which red
flames lick at the edge. To proceed in this direction would mean you
have to plunge into the middle of this fiery pit; an unpalatable choice
at best. Perhaps you'd prefer the safer course to suicide, which lies 
back to the east, where you may proceed down the bone bridge.

The path here skirts a bottomless gorge that looms to the left, filled
partially by searing flame, into which a multitude of sinners are thrust
by tiny, grinning imps with pitchforks. The stench of burning flesh is
overpowering, and threatens to induce nausea, though the sickening odor
is overshadowed by the sight of bags of naked, screaming children, the
offspring of the damned, being flung into pits of fire and trampled by
grinning fiery giants, who take a disturbing pride in their work.

At this point a narrow path winds downwards to the southeast, a thin
frame of bones covered with stretched skin, that descends into the
gorge, towards whatever may lie at the bottom. The path continues to
the west along the gorge, but appears to end abruptly at a sheer drop
into the fiery pit.

The bone path you are following stretches across the gorge, the flames
failing to reach the bridge itself, though the immense heat is still
almost overwhelming. On the far side, it reaches a dark hole which 
plunges down into the gloomy depths, towards whatever may lie there in
wait for you. Shrieking, flaming bats circle the bridge, soaring far
above and below, not coming too close.

You plunge downwards into the pit, striking the soft earth at the very
bottom, sinking in to your knees in the bloodsoaked dirt. Peering up,
you see that the top of the pit is some distance away, and a magical
enchantment would be required to head back that way. Footprints in the
dirt show that you are not the first to have ventured this far.

The earth hardens here, forcing you out as it compresses into a hard,
stony substance that yields little underfoot. A dank, dusty odor fills
the air, though the area is devoid of corpses; only blank stone walls
are visible, stretching far to the south. The odor from the pit to the
east makes you keen to press on. More bodies can be seen to the south;
the respite was only brief.

As you step into the cave, the entrance mysteriously disappears, leaving
you trapped in the darkness, with no means of escape. You try every spell
and trick you know, but all is in vain. Eventually malnutrition gets the
better of you and you slowly perish in this; one of Hel's favorite death
traps, your body never to be seen again.

A Dead End~

The tunnel ends here, before the entrance to more caves, a couple of
them to the east large enough for you to crawl into, if you don't mind
having to slither amongst the foul pale humanoids that reside within,
exuding a thick grey mucous from their pores that renders them slick
and lubricated. The stench is, not surprisingly, quite unbearable, and
you find yourself desperately wishing to be away from here, away from
Niflheim, away from Asgard, away from all things not of Midgaard.

Several dark tunnels meet here, heading into the dark, dismal depths of
Niflheim. Bursts of flame explode from small holes in the floor at
random intervals, of too brief duration to injure you, but sufficient to
cause you to start in surprise and fear. Dark cave entrances abound
everywhere, most of them crawling with the pale bodies of the damned,
writhing like maggots over and around each other, doomed to spend milennia
in this form, as partial attrition for their sins.

with each other, and wonder if it would be safe to enter this place,
seeing as the comforting surrounds of Yggdrasil feel so safe and secure.

Here Hel sits in judgement over those who have been damned to spend all of
eternity in the infernal region that bears her name. A vile, malicious and
utterly evil god, she delights in the torment and suffering of others,
especially mortals from Midgaard who wander into her domain inadvertently!
Tall columns of flame flicker to either side of a throne of bone, upon which
the unholy god sits, and a multitude of small demons and imps scurry here and
there, dragging in fresh corpses, piles of intestines, and other pleasant
accoutrements to add to her hellish demesne.

The Base of Yggdrasil~

You have finally reached the roots of the Tree of Life, the base from
which all knowledge and wisdom sprouts. Here the Norns- Urd, Verdandi
and Skuld- tend the tree, and prophesise the future. It was here that 
Odin gained his ability of prophesy, and paid the terrible price for the
gift. The Norns remain absolutely impartial in all affairs of mortal and
god, and favor neither side in any conflict. Their abode is encased in
a shimmering sphere of grey energy, which obscures the rest of the tree.
A large scrying device- a pool of glistening water that looks strangely
attuned to magical energies- covers the floor, through which the Norn
may observe the goings-on of Midgaard.
